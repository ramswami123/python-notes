Sure! Here are detailed answers for each of the Python interview questions:

### **1. Python Basics**
1. **What is Python? What are its key features?**
   - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its key features include:
     - **Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is straightforward and easy to understand.
     - **Interpreted**: No compilation needed; the code is executed line by line.
     - **Dynamically Typed**: Variables do not need to declare their type.
     - **Extensive Libraries**: Python has libraries for almost every task, from web development to machine learning.
     - **Cross-Platform**: Python can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.
     - **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming, including concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

2. **Explain the difference between Python 2 and Python 3.**
   - **Print Statement**: In Python 2, `print` is a statement (`print "Hello"`). In Python 3, it's a function (`print("Hello")`).
   - **Integer Division**: In Python 2, dividing integers truncates the result (`5 / 2 = 2`). In Python 3, it returns a float (`5 / 2 = 2.5`).
   - **Unicode**: Python 3 uses Unicode by default for strings, whereas Python 2 uses ASCII.
   - **Libraries**: Many libraries have transitioned to Python 3, and Python 2 has reached its end of life.

3. **How is memory managed in Python?**
   - Python uses **automatic memory management** and a built-in **garbage collector** to manage memory. Memory management is handled by Python's **private heap space**, and developers don’t have direct access to it. Python manages:
     - **Reference Counting**: When an object’s reference count reaches zero, it’s automatically garbage collected.
     - **Garbage Collection**: The garbage collector reclaims cyclic references.

4. **What are mutable and immutable types? Give examples.**
   - **Mutable types** can be changed after creation, while **immutable types** cannot.
     - **Mutable**: List, Dictionary, Set
     - **Immutable**: Tuple, String, Integer, Float

5. **What are decorators in Python? Can you write an example?**
   - A **decorator** is a function that takes another function as an argument and extends or alters its behavior.
   ```python
   def decorator_function(original_function):
       def wrapper_function():
           print("Wrapper executed before {}".format(original_function.__name__))
           return original_function()
       return wrapper_function

   @decorator_function
   def display():
       print("Display function ran")

   display()  
   ```

6. **Explain the difference between `deepcopy()` and `copy()` in Python.**
   - `copy()` creates a **shallow copy**, meaning it only copies the references of nested objects (not the objects themselves). Modifying a nested object affects both the original and the copy.
   - `deepcopy()` creates a **deep copy**, meaning it copies everything, including nested objects. Modifying the copy doesn’t affect the original.

7. **What are Python's built-in data types?**
   - Python provides several built-in types, including:
     - **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`
     - **Sequence Types**: `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `range`
     - **Mapping Type**: `dict`
     - **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`
     - **Boolean Type**: `bool`
     - **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

8. **How are arguments passed in Python: by reference or by value?**
   - Python uses a system called **pass-by-object-reference**. When an object is passed to a function, it passes the reference to the object, not the actual object. For mutable objects, the function can modify the object. For immutable objects, the function cannot modify the object itself.

### **2. Data Structures and Algorithms**
1. **How does Python implement lists and tuples? What are the key differences between them?**
   - **Lists**: Implemented as dynamic arrays. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation.
   - **Tuples**: Implemented similarly but are immutable. Once created, the content of a tuple cannot be modified.

2. **What are list comprehensions in Python?**
   - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists by iterating over sequences in a single line of code.
   ```python
   squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
   ```

3. **Explain sets and dictionaries in Python and their use cases.**
   - **Sets** are unordered collections of unique elements. Use cases include removing duplicates and membership testing.
   - **Dictionaries** are key-value pairs. Use cases include fast lookups, as dictionary operations are on average O(1).

4. **How would you implement a stack/queue in Python?**
   - Stack (LIFO) can be implemented using a list and its `append()` and `pop()` methods.
   ```python
   stack = []
   stack.append(1)
   stack.pop()
   ```
   - Queue (FIFO) can be implemented using `collections.deque`.
   ```python
   from collections import deque
   queue = deque()
   queue.append(1)
   queue.popleft()
   ```

5. **Explain the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy.**
   - A **shallow copy** copies the object but references nested objects (not copying them). A **deep copy** copies everything, including nested objects.

6. **How would you reverse a string in Python?**
   ```python
   reversed_string = "hello"[::-1]
   ```

7. **Explain how sorting works in Python. How can you sort a list of dictionaries by a key?**
   - Python uses **Timsort**, an optimized merge sort.
   ```python
   sorted_list = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda d: d['key_name'])
   ```

8. **How would you find duplicates in a list?**
   ```python
   duplicates = [item for item in set(my_list) if my_list.count(item) > 1]
   ```

### **3. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
1. **What are the four principles of OOP?**
   - **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
   - **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
   - **Polymorphism**: The ability to use a function or method in different ways.
   - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details and showing only the necessary parts of an object.

2. **How would you implement encapsulation in Python?**
   - Use **private variables** by prefixing with `_` or `__`.
   ```python
   class MyClass:
       def __init__(self):
           self._protected = "protected"
           self.__private = "private"
   ```

3. **What is inheritance? How does Python support multiple inheritance?**
   - Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Python supports multiple inheritance by allowing a class to inherit from more than one base class:
   ```python
   class ChildClass(Parent1, Parent2):
       pass
   ```

4. **What is method overriding and method overloading? Does Python support them?**
   - **Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method in the parent class.
   - **Method overloading** is defining multiple methods with the same name but different signatures. Python does not support overloading directly, but you can achieve similar functionality with default parameters.

5. **What is polymorphism? Can you provide an example?**
   - Polymorphism allows methods to have different behaviors based on the object calling them.
   ```python
   class Animal:
       def sound(self):
           pass
   class Dog(Animal):
       def sound(self):
           return "Bark"
   class Cat(Animal):
       def sound(self):
           return "Meow"
   ```

6. **What are static methods and class methods? How are they different in Python?**
   - **Static methods**: Defined using `@staticmethod`. They do not access the class or instance, used when functionality doesn’t depend on class attributes.
   - **Class methods**: Defined using `@classmethod`. They take `cls` as a parameter and can modify class state.

7. **What are metaclasses in Python?**
   - Metaclasses are classes for classes. They define the behavior of a class (such as how to create it).
   ```python
   class Meta(type):
       def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
           return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)
   ```

### **4. Exception Handling**
1. **What is exception handling in Python? How is it implemented?**
   - Exception handling manages runtime errors in a program. It’s implemented using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks.
   ```python
   try:
       x = 1 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Cannot divide by zero")
   finally:
       print("This runs regardless")
   ```

2. **What is the purpose of the `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks?**
   - **try**: Runs the code that might raise an exception.
   - **except**: Catches and handles

 the exception.
   - **finally**: Runs code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
   - **else**: Runs code if no exceptions were raised.

3. **How do you raise exceptions in Python? Can you create custom exceptions?**
   - Use the `raise` keyword to raise exceptions.
   ```python
   raise ValueError("Invalid input")
   ```
   - To create custom exceptions, inherit from the `Exception` class:
   ```python
   class CustomError(Exception):
       pass
   ```

4. **What are some common Python exceptions, and when do they occur?**
   - **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.
   - **TypeError**: Raised when an operation is performed on an incorrect type.
   - **IndexError**: Raised when accessing an invalid index in a list.
   - **KeyError**: Raised when accessing an invalid key in a dictionary.
   - **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when dividing by zero.

### **5. File Handling**
1. **How do you open, read, and write files in Python?**
   - Use the `open()` function to open a file, `read()` to read, and `write()` to write to a file.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
       data = file.read()
   ```

2. **What is the difference between the `with` statement and `open()` when working with files?**
   - The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
       pass  # No need to manually close the file
   ```

3. **How would you handle large files in Python?**
   - Handle large files by reading them in chunks using a loop:
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
       while chunk := file.read(1024):  # Reads in 1KB chunks
           process(chunk)
   ```

4. **What are the various file modes available in Python?**
   - **'r'**: Read (default mode)
   - **'w'**: Write (truncates the file)
   - **'a'**: Append
   - **'rb' / 'wb'**: Read/write binary

Sure, Geeta! Here's a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Python:

### **Node Class**
First, we define a `Node` class to represent each element in the linked list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

### **LinkedList Class**
Next, we define a `LinkedList` class to manage the nodes.

```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node

    def delete_node(self, key):
        current_node = self.head

        if current_node and current_node.data == key:
            self.head = current_node.next
            current_node = None
            return

        prev = None
        while current_node and current_node.data != key:
            prev = current_node
            current_node = current_node.next

        if current_node is None:
            return

        prev.next = current_node.next
        current_node = None

    def print_list(self):
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node:
            print(current_node.data, end=" -> ")
            current_node = current_node.next
        print("None")
```

### **Usage Example**
Here's how you can use the `LinkedList` class:

```python
# Create a linked list
llist = LinkedList()

# Insert elements
llist.insert_at_beginning(1)
llist.insert_at_end(2)
llist.insert_at_end(3)
llist.insert_at_beginning(0)

# Print the linked list
llist.print_list()  # Output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None

# Delete a node
llist.delete_node(2)

# Print the linked list again
llist.print_list()  # Output: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> None
```

This implementation covers basic operations like inserting at the beginning, inserting at the end, deleting a node, and printing the linked list¹².

Do you have any specific operations or features you want to add to this linked list?

Sorting in Python can be done using the `sort()` method or the `sorted()` function. Here's a quick overview of both:

### **Using `sort()` Method**
The `sort()` method sorts the list in place, meaning it modifies the original list.

**Syntax**:
```python
list_name.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
```
- **key**: A function that serves as a key for the sort comparison.
- **reverse**: If `True`, the list is sorted in descending order.

**Example**:
```python
numbers = [4, 2, 9, 1]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 9]

# Sorting in descending order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 4, 2, 1]
```

### **Using `sorted()` Function**
The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list without modifying the original list.

**Syntax**:
```python
sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)
```
- **iterable**: The sequence to sort (e.g., list, tuple).
- **key**: A function that serves as a key for the sort comparison.
- **reverse**: If `True`, the list is sorted in descending order.

**Example**:
```python
numbers = [4, 2, 9, 1]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 9]
print(numbers)  # Output: [4, 2, 9, 1] (original list remains unchanged)

# Sorting in descending order
sorted_numbers_desc = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
print(sorted_numbers_desc)  # Output: [9, 4, 2, 1]
```

Both methods are quite powerful and can be customized using the `key` parameter to sort complex data structures¹².
